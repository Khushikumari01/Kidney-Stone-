Kidney Stone Detection using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

This project is a kidney stone detection system that uses medical images to classify whether a patient has kidney stones or not. It combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for deep learning-based image classification and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using HOG features for traditional machine learning. A simple user interface is also provided using Gradio and Tkinter to make the system easy to use for doctors or general users
